The features include:
 * Easily start and stop the server with two simple buttons.
 * Give helper, write the names of one or more players, select an item and a quantity and press give!
 * Auto Command System, ACS, execute a list of commands with a set delay in seconds.
 * File executor, execute a file containing a server command on each line and the server will execute them.

Features still in development:
 * Backup feature, roll back the server after a grief attack!
